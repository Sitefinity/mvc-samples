# Calendar view for Events widget using Kendo Scheduler

    This smaple has been removed since the functionality that it provides, is now part of Sitefinity. In order to display Sitefinity events inside [Kendo Scheduler](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/scheduling/scheduler/overview) just drag the MVC Calendar widget on your page.
    For additional information check the official [Sitefinity documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/calendar-widget-mvc).
